# **Predictors of Health Insurance Charges**
This project involved analysing healthcare insurance data to evaluate the influence of individual characteristics and geographic setting on insurance costs. A predictive model was developed to estimate healthcare expenditures and deliver actionable, data-driven insights to enhance the accuracy of insurance charge forecasting. 

## Datasets
The project used publicly available data, which was accessed from the following Kaggle website on 14 October 2025. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/healthcare-insurance. The dataset contains personal and geographic details—such as age, gender, BMI, family size, and smoking status—used to evaluate their influence on medical insurance charges and to develop models for predicting healthcare costs.

## Business Requirements
Develop a data-driven model to predict health insurance costs using individual and geographic factors, providing insights for executive decision-making.

## Analytical questions
The analysis was driven by the following key questions:
* Do the health insurance charges vary by individual characteristics (i.e., sex, smoking status, BMI)?
* Is the location (geographical regions) associated with health insurance charges?
* What are the key predictors of insurance charges?

## Project plan
The project tasks were managed using the project board in GitHub. The following activities were conducted.
* Develop a comprehensive project plan outlining the necessary tasks.
* Establish a project board on Github and incorporate the project plans into the board.
* Import relevant data and packages into Jupyter notebooks.
* Undertake thorough data exploration.
* Execute data manipulation processes, including necessary transformations.
* Create visualizations to analyse health insurance charges by sex, smoking status, BMI, and number of children, assessing potential differences among individual characteristics.
* Use graphical methods to evaluate variations in insurance charges across different regions.
* Build and validate a predictive model for insurance health charges.

## The rationale to map the business requirements to Data Visualizations
This project necessitates two distinct types of analysis to effectively address the business requirements.
* Descriptive analysis: This process involved calculating frequencies, means, medians, and counts to examine the data and identify patterns, trends, and relationships. These methods provide an overview of past events in the dataset. Various visualizations were applied, including bar graphs, box plots, heatmaps, and histograms, to represent the data.
* Predictive analysis: Advanced regression techniques were employed to construct a predictive model for healthcare insurance. An interactive graph was created to effectively illustrate the influence of individual factors on insurance expenditures.

## Analysis techniques used
* Descriptive: frequencies, counts, correlations, mean, and median.
* Linear regression and forest plots
* Visualizations: Boxplots, bar graphs, histograms, heatmaps, line plot.

## Ethics Considerations
The data did not contain personal identifiable information, and therefore there were no associated privacy issues.

## Development roadmap
I have primarily used the LMS for analytical work. This was my initial project completed using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. A significant aspect of the process was installing numerous libraries required for certain code to function.

## Main Data Analysis Libraries
